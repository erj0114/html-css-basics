# HTML
HTML is composed of plain text and tags or 'mark-up' that help distinguish one set of content (text, images, audio, and/or video) from another and allow you to control the general top to bottom left to right layout.

Some basic HTML tags their meaning and usage

| Tag | Meaning | Usage
| --- | ---| --- |
| html | Wraps the entire contents of the html file | `<html></html>`
| head | Loaded before the body the head can contain scripts that need to be loaded/executed before the body of the page is loaded.  The head also contains the title tag and any meta data tags which can contain search engine keywords, browser settings, or other data about the data (metadata).| `<head></head>`
| title | `Title` tag is wrapped by `head` tag and is used to set the page title for the browser tab title and bookmarking purposes. | `<title>This is the page title</title>`
| style | Typically in the head tag allows you to define CSS in the same file as the HTML (usually better to use link explained below for keeping CSS outside the HTML for organization purposes) | `<style>.some-class { background-color: red; } </style>`
| link | The link tag despite its name doesn't actually create a link but instead links in external resources (usually used for loading external CSS files) | `<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='some-file.css'>`
| script | Script tags can be in the head or body of a html page and load external javascript files to run in the browser | `<script src='some-file.js'></script>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />
    <script src="main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    A very basic web page so far...
</body>
</html>
